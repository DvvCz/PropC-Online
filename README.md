# PropC Online
Program in C/C++ with Propeller C for Parallax Activity Boards.
This is an alternative to the solo editor.

Uses [monaco](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor) for the editor, [BlocklyPropLauncher](https://github.com/parallaxinc/BlocklyPropLauncher) to communicate with your robot, and [Solo](https://github.com/parallaxinc/solo) to compile the PropC code.
