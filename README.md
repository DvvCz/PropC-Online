# PropC Online
Program in propc online for parallax activity boards.

Uses [monaco](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor) for the editor, [BlocklyPropLauncher](https://github.com/parallaxinc/BlocklyPropLauncher) to communicate with your robot, and [Solo](https://github.com/parallaxinc/solo) to compile the PropC code.

## Features
* Themes (Visual Studio Light and Dark)
* On the fly compilation
* Diagnostics inline in the editor (warnings, errors)
* Write in raw (Prop)C instead of blocks like with Solo.
* Everything that monaco brings (Code folding, autocomplete, etc.)
* Autocomplete from Parallax Standard Libraries
